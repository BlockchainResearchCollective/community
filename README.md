# Blockchain Research Collective (Singapore)

Welcome to the Collective! We hope to create a space for those interested in the technical aspects of blockchain technology in Singapore.

## Why do we exist?
We'd like to take this chance to bring together the research community in Singapore through collaboratively building resources and holding meaningful events of a technical nature.
* Undergraduates: 
  1. Contribute to our ongoing projects
  1. Hold workshops at your respective education instutitions.
* Researchers: 
  1. Share your work
  1. Pose open research questions and gather feedback

## What's been happening
We came together at [Blockchain Fundamentals Technical Reading Group](https://blockchain-nus.github.io/) and felt very strongly that such platforms held great promise for the Singapore community. It was an open space where we could discuss issues while learning about core aspects of blockchain technology.
