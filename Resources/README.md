# Resources
This repository contains a collection of presentations conducted by various groups in our respective Universities.

## Contribute
If you've had a presentation conducted of a technical nature,
1. feel free to upload your presentation in pdf (so it is viewable in Github) 
1. update the webpage with the details of your presentation so we know when and where it occurred!


Currently we are focusing on collating the work that has been done thus far so that we can be a conduit into the research scene in Singapore
